## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Advanced Image Generation
- **Powered by Gemini Models**: Support for `gemini-2.5-flash-image` (Nano Banana) and `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` (Nano Banana Pro).
- **Pro-Level Controls**: Fine-tune Aspect Ratio, Style, Resolution (up to 4K), and Negative Prompts.
- **Smart Assets**: Upload reference images to control **Identity (Character)**, **Structure (Pose/Layout)**, and **Style (Vibe)** independently.

### 🎥 Cinematic Video Creation
- **Veo Model Integration**: Generate high-quality videos using Google's latest `Veo` model (`veo-3.1`).
- **Video Extension**: Upload existing videos and extend them seamlessly (720p).
- **Keyframe & Reference Control**: Use images to guide the start/end frames or lock character consistency in videos.

### 🤖 Deep Agent Assistant
- **Thinking Process**: The AI Assistant doesn't just reply; it *thinks*, plans, and executes complex workflows.
- **Autonomous Control**: The Agent can autonomously control the studio interface, changing models, parameters, and initiating generation based on natural language requests.
- **Refinement**: Ask the agent to "Make it more cinematic" or "Fix the hands," and it will adjust prompts and settings for you.

### 🖌️ Editor & Inpainting
- **Canvas Editor**: Integrated editor for masking and inpainting.
- **Region-Based Editing**: Define specific regions with instructions (e.g., "Make this shirt red") while keeping the rest of the image intact.

### 🛡️ Privacy & Security (BYOK)
- **Bring Your Own Key**: Your API Key is stored securely in your likely browser's **Local Storage**.
- **No Middleman**: Requests go directly from your browser to Google's servers. We do not store or see your keys.
